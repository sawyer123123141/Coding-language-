//! `draw.rects`: many rectangles of one size and colour in one GPU draw call, and `span`, which
//! every rectangle native uses for a negative size.
//!
//! raylib's shape functions feed each rectangle's vertices to its batch one call at a time, which
//! is most of what a `draw.rect` costs. Here a call's rectangles are written into one reused
//! vertex buffer and drawn as a dynamic raylib mesh, with the window's default material
//! (`material.rs`) and the 2D projection raylib set up for the window. raylib means meshes for 3D,
//! so drawing one in 2D needs care:
//!
//! - **Order.** raylib's batch still holds the shapes drawn before the call. It is drawn first
//!   (`rlDrawRenderBatchActive`), so they stay underneath. Shapes drawn after the call go into the
//!   emptied batch and come out on top.
//! - **Winding.** The 2D projection turns y upside down, so culling is turned off around the
//!   draw, and either winding shows.
//! - **Depth.** See `Z`.
//! - **Colour.** The mesh has no colours or texture coordinates. A mesh without colours gets
//!   OpenGL's current value of the colour attribute, which raylib only ever sets to white
//!   (`UploadMesh` does, for a mesh like this one); and the default material's texture is a white
//!   pixel. So the shader's result is the material's diffuse colour: the rectangles' colour, in the
//!   same 8 bits a `draw.rect` of that colour uses.
//! - **What `DrawMesh` leaves behind.** It puts raylib's modelview and projection matrices back
//!   itself, and unbinds its shader, vertex array, buffers and texture. It leaves the default
//!   shader's `colDiffuse` uniform at the rectangles' colour, but raylib's batch sets that back to
//!   white whenever it draws, along with its own shader, vertex array, texture and MVP matrix.
//!   Culling is turned back on here (raylib's 2D state). So the batch draws as before.
//!
//! The mesh is one per window. Its capacity doubles when a call needs more rectangles, up to
//! `MOST_PER_DRAW`; a bigger call draws in parts of that many, in order. It is freed when the
//! window closes (`gpu::close_all`).
