//! The window's state, and the switch between the two backends.
//!
//! A program has one window, used from the thread that runs `main`, so the
//! state is a `thread_local`. It is *not opened*, *open* or *closed*.
//!
//! - The **real** backend drives raylib.
//! - The **headless** backend (`KESTREL_HEADLESS=<n>`) makes no raylib call:
//!   `frame()` gives `true` `n` times, the clock is 60 frames a second, and
//!   the natives print what they would have drawn (see `headless.rs`), unless
//!   `KESTREL_HEADLESS_QUIET=1` turns the lines off.
//! - The **replay** backend (`kestrel replay`) is the headless one, whatever the environment
//!   says, with as many frames as the recording ran (`kestrel_runtime::replay::note_frame`). It
//!   prints the headless lines only when the recording was made headless and not quiet, since
//!   only that recording has them to compare.
//!
//! Both follow the same rules, so a program behaves alike on either:
//! `close()` only asks, and the next `frame()` closes the window and gives
//! `false`. After that `frame()` keeps giving `false`, drawing and
//! `window.screenshot` are errors, and the queries (`delta`, `time`, `ticks_usec`,
//! `size`, `fps`) give the values they had at the end, because raylib has nothing
//! left to ask. Input reads as nothing.
//!
//! The GPU objects (`gpu.rs`) are freed at the start of each frame, once raylib has drawn
//! everything batched, and all of them when the window closes, in the real case before
//! raylib closes. A 3D pass (`pass.rs`) ends before the frame does, and every frame starts in 2D.
//!
//! The `check_*` functions give an error message instead of failing, so tests
//! can see the message. The same functions without the prefix call
//! `kestrel_runtime::panic::fail_at_call` with it, which adds the line of the program's call.
