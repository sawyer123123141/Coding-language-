//! Generics in the checker: placeholders (`Ty::Param`), interned type lists, instances of generic
//! structs and enums (`Stack[int]`), and substitution.
//!
//! A generic declaration is a `StructId` / `EnumId` whose `params` aren't empty; its fields use
//! `Ty::Param`, and as a type it means itself with its own placeholders (`Stack[T]`). Every other
//! use is an instance, interned once per (declaration, type list) with its fields filled in, so
//! every type question works on it unchanged (G12).
