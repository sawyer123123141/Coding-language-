//! Which types can be `T` (R3, R7): not owning, not an optional, not a function type and not a
//! type holding a function (R3, G6), and meeting every rule of the placeholder (R7).
//!
//! Written instances (`Stack[X]`) are checked where they are written. During `collect` the
//! arguments are queued (owning-ness and instances' fields aren't known yet) and checked after
//! `compute_owning` (phase 7); in bodies they are checked at once, and an instance with a refused
//! argument isn't made (the written type is `Error`). Queued instances already exist, but they
//! are only in a program with errors, which is never lowered, and `compute_owning` gives every
//! instance its declaration's owning-ness, so none is owning because of its arguments.
