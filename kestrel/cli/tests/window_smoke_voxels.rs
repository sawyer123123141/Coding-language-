//! The real-window test for the voxel viewer's world: its faces drawn on the GPU, seen from above,
//! under both `kestrel run` (the JIT) and `kestrel build` (an exe). The shared machinery is in
//! `common/smoke.rs`; the winding rule itself is checked in `window_smoke_mesh.rs`, and the world's
//! faces are checked in pure Kestrel in `voxels_demo.rs`. This one checks that they meet: the
//! world's top faces are wound so that, seen from above, they are drawn, in full brightness.
//!
//! The window is hidden (`KESTREL_HIDDEN=1`), so no window appears while these run (see
//! `common/smoke.rs` for `KESTREL_SMOKE_VISIBLE`).

/// (0.98, so the bytes are under `SNOW`'s 237, 242, 247). The eight blocks around it in the air
/// layer above are all air, so all four corners have full ambient occlusion (brightness 1) and
/// the face is this one colour all over. Its four neighbours' tops differ (their own variation),
/// so no other block's top gives exactly these bytes there. (A scratch program printed each top
/// block of the column with its height, the air around it and its colour's bytes.)

/// One column of the world, the four chunks at x and z 0, seen from straight above: the camera is
/// at (16, 300, 16), over the column's middle, looking straight down with a narrow 12-degree field
/// of view, so every ray is close to vertical and the view is nearly a map. A camera looking down
/// lines up with the usual up (+y), which `draw3d.camera` refuses, so up is +z here: +z is up on
/// the screen and +x is left.
///
/// The column covers 32 by 32 blocks. The window's half-height is `(300 - h) * tan(6°)` blocks at
/// height h, so the 128 pixels cover 43.5 blocks at h = 93 (2.94 pixels a block, the column 94
/// pixels across) and 38.9 at h = 115, the top of the highest block (3.29 pixels a block, the
/// column 105 pixels). The window's corners show the background.
///
/// Each block has its own slight colour, so a pixel is one face's colour only if all of its
/// samples land on that face, which needs faces a few pixels wide: hence the window of 128
/// pixels and the narrow view. Block (15, 92, 15)'s top (at height 93) covers x and y 64.0 to 66.9
/// on the screen, so pixel (65, 65) lies in its middle.
///
/// The top faces are what the camera sees, so if the world's top faces were wound the wrong way
/// they would be culled and the column would show no top at all. That exact pixel is the winding
/// check: a side face would be 0.8 or 0.7 as bright, and with the top faces wound the wrong way
/// (65, 65) comes out a different colour while the `inked` rectangle can still pass (the view then
/// holds other faces), so `inked` alone would not catch it. `inked` only shows that something is
/// drawn in the middle.
