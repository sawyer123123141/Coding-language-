//! The real-window tests for what is still waiting in raylib's batch of shapes when something else
//! happens: a GPU object is freed (`gpu::drain`), or `draw.clear` clears the screen. Each draws in
//! a hidden window, takes a screenshot and checks its pixels, under both `kestrel run` (the JIT)
//! and `kestrel build` (an exe). The shared machinery is in `common/smoke.rs`.
//!
//! raylib batches shapes: `draw.rect`, a sprite and the like are only drawn on the GPU when the
//! batch is flushed (before a mesh draw, a screenshot, the end of the frame...), while a clear acts
//! at once.
//!
//! The window is hidden (`KESTREL_HIDDEN=1`), so no window appears while these run (see
//! `common/smoke.rs` for `KESTREL_SMOKE_VISIBLE`).
