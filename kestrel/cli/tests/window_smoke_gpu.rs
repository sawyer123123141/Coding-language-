//! The real-window tests for textures, sprites, bulk rectangles and 3D shapes (and, in later tasks, meshes):
//! draw on the GPU, take a screenshot and check its pixels, under both `kestrel run` (the JIT)
//! and `kestrel build` (an exe). The shared machinery is in `common/smoke.rs`; the shapes and
//! text are in `window_smoke.rs`.
//!
//! The window is hidden (`KESTREL_HIDDEN=1`), so no window appears while these run. If this
//! machine's driver doesn't render hidden windows, set `KESTREL_SMOKE_VISIBLE=1` in the
//! environment of `cargo test`: then, when the hidden run behaved (exit 0, the expected stdout)
//! and only the screenshot's pixels differ, the program runs again with a visible window and the
//! test asserts on that run. Without it a hidden run whose pixels differ fails at once.
