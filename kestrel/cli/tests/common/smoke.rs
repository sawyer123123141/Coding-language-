//! What the tests that open a real window share: run a program in a hidden window, take a
//! screenshot, and check its pixels, under both `kestrel run` (the JIT) and `kestrel build` (an exe).
//!
//! The window is hidden (`KESTREL_HIDDEN=1`), so nothing appears on screen. Some machine's driver
//! might not render a hidden window; for that, `KESTREL_SMOKE_VISIBLE=1` in the environment of the
//! test process lets a run whose pixels were off (and nothing else) repeat with a visible window.
//!
//! Every CLI test crate includes this through `common`, and most don't use it, so
//! `common/mod.rs` allows dead code.
