//! The tests that open a real window: draw on the GPU, take a screenshot and check its pixels,
//! under both `kestrel run` (the JIT) and `kestrel build` (an exe). The shared machinery is in
//! `common/smoke.rs`; the textures are in `window_smoke_gpu.rs`.
//!
//! The window is hidden (`KESTREL_HIDDEN=1`) so the test doesn't flash a window at whoever runs
//! it, and a window never appears unless you ask. A hidden window might not render on some
//! machine's driver. If this machine's driver doesn't render hidden windows, set
//! `KESTREL_SMOKE_VISIBLE=1` in the environment of `cargo test`: then, when the hidden run
//! behaved (exit 0, the expected stdout) and only the screenshot's pixels differ, the program
//! runs again with a visible window and the test asserts on that run, saying on stderr which
//! mode passed. Without it a hidden run whose pixels differ fails at once. Any other failure
//! (a crash, a wrong exit code, wrong output) fails at once either way: a visible window would
//! not fix it.
