//! The real-window tests for meshes: draw on the GPU, take a screenshot and check its pixels,
//! under both `kestrel run` (the JIT) and `kestrel build` (an exe). The shared machinery is in
//! `common/smoke.rs`; textures, bulk rectangles and 3D shapes are in `window_smoke_gpu.rs`.
//!
//! The window is hidden (`KESTREL_HIDDEN=1`), so no window appears while these run (see
//! `common/smoke.rs` for `KESTREL_SMOKE_VISIBLE`).
//!
//! **Where things land.** Every case's camera is at (0, 0, -3), looking at the origin with y up,
//! and the window is 64 by 64. The camera looks along +z, so the screen's right is
//! `forward × up = (0, 0, 1) × (0, 1, 0) = (-1, 0, 0)`: **+x is on the screen's left**. With the
//! default 75-degree field of view, a point at z = 0 is 3 units away, where the screen's half-height
//! is `3 × tan(37.5°) = 2.302` units, so one unit is `32 / 2.302 = 13.9` pixels: a world point
//! (x, y, 0) lands at pixel (32 - 13.9 x, 32 - 13.9 y). The square with corners at x and y = ±1
//! covers pixels 18.1 to 45.9 both ways. Pixels are checked at least two pixels inside or outside
//! an edge, because the window is multisampled.

/// d = (-1, 1, 0). On the screen (x to the right is -x in the world, y up) its corners are

/// (-1 - 1) + (-1 - 1) + (-1 - 1) + (-1 - 1) = -8: negative, so clockwise (with y up), and the
/// spec's example, `quad((0,0,0), (1,0,0), (1,1,0), (0,1,0))` from a camera at z = -3, gives
/// -2 the same way. So the red quad faces the camera. The green one is a d c b: counter-clockwise,
/// so it faces away and must not show.
///
/// The red quad is drawn moved by (1.1, 0, 0), so it covers x from 0.1 to 2.1: pixels 2.8 to 30.6

/// The mesh draws must leave raylib's culling as it was (back faces culled). A cube around the
/// camera, drawn before the meshes and again after them, checks it: seen from inside, each of its
/// faces is a back face to raylib, so it shows nothing, unless the meshes' setting reached it (the
/// one before is still in raylib's batch when the first mesh is drawn). Then the whole screen would
