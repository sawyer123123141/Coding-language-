//! Record and replay (the I/O round's spec, decision 7).
//!
//! `kestrel run --record` turns recording on before the program starts; `kestrel replay` turns
//! replaying on with a file's contents. Every native of `window`, `draw`, `draw3d`, `input` and
//! `time` that gives a result passes it through `record_or_play` (`window.frame` through
//! `frame`): a recording appends it to the native log, and a replay hands back the logged value
//! instead, after checking that the log names the same native. Every line `print` writes to
//! stdout reaches `print_bytes`, which keeps it (recording) or compares it with the recorded line
//! (replaying). `finish` ends either when `main` returns, and the runtime's `fail` calls
//! `on_failure` before it exits, so a failure is recorded, and replayed, too.
//!
//! The native log's ids are `NativeId`'s (`ids.rs`), one per logged native in module order.
//!
//! Natives run on the program's main thread, but `print` may run on a `par for` thread too, so
//! the state is behind a `Mutex`. When nothing is recorded or replayed, a native pays one atomic load.
