//! Loops, analysed as `while` loops: the state at the top is found by repeating the body to a
//! fixed point, widening the ranges that still grow and dropping the facts that got weaker; then
//! one more pass, with that state, decides the checks. A check is decided only in the final pass
//! of every loop around it, so an inner loop skips its deciding pass unless every loop around it
//! is deciding. Also the `Prove` block an annotated loop is lowered into (`region`).
