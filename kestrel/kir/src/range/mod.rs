//! Range analysis: proves which overflow, shift, division, narrowing and bounds checks can never
//! fail, marks them (`ExprKind::Proven`, `IndexCheck::Proven`), and says which checks are left and
//! why. It runs on KIR after `optimize`, one function at a time, interpreting each function
//! abstractly: a range for every tracked integer local and facts `a - b <= c` between terms
//! (`terms`, `facts`, `state`), one statement at a time (see `stmt`), conditions refining both
//! (`refine`), loops repeated to a fixed point (`loops`). See the range-analysis design spec.
