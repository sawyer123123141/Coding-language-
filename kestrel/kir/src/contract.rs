//! `@prove` contracts as KIR keeps them: one `ContractSite` per function, method or loop that
//! promises something (an interface method's promise becomes a site on each implementing method),
//! listed in `Module::contracts`. The code a site covers is marked where it is not a whole
//! function: lowering wraps an annotated loop's statements in `Stmt::Prove { id }`, and the inliner
//! wraps each expanded copy of a contracted callee the same way (`id` is the site's index).
//! Range analysis tags each check and event with the `Prove` blocks around it (its regions).
