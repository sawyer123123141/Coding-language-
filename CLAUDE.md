# Kestrel

A compiled language for games (Rust + Cranelift). The compiler is the Cargo workspace in `kestrel/`. The old `kestrelc/` and `kestrel.js` implementations were removed in October 2026; they are in git history only.

## Start here

**Read `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-10-handoff.md` first.** Its top "Start here" section has the current status and the next task (determinism round 1 is done, 2026-10-28, on `main`: Kestrel's own math, the float mode pinned, `@prove(deterministic)`, `Rng` and `checksum`, storage-reusing assignment for snapshots, and a rollback Pong demo in `kestrel/demos/pong/`, with results in `kestrel/bench/determinism/results.md`; generics are done, 2026-10-25; the voxel engine version 1 is built, reviewed and measured, 2026-10-26, in `kestrel/voxel/`, with its spec `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-25-voxel-engine-design.md` and plan `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-25-voxel-engine.md`; the KIR inliner works bottom-up, 2026-10-26; the fast float math round is done, 2026-10-29 (`float` math is Kestrel's own wide functions, at most 0.51 ulp and the same bits everywhere, inlined branch-free except `pow`, with loop-invariant math computed once before the loop; spec `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-28-fast-math-design.md`, numbers in `kestrel/bench/determinism/results.md`); the user played `voxel/main.kes` ("feels good"); next are the user's play test of `demos/pong/pong.kes`, then the order the user picks from `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-29-roadmap-proposal.md`: the recorded order is the GPU round (`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-27-gpu-proposal.md`) then determinism round 2 (`to_bytes`, a file module, replay files); the roadmap proposes the I/O round, hot reload and a rollback library first, with five open questions for the user); the rest has the user's decisions and preferences and environment gotchas.

## Where things are

- Language design: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-09-kestrel-syntax-design.md`
- Compiler design: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-09-kestrel-core-rebuild-design.md`
- Plans and open follow-ups: `docs/superpowers/plans/` (`2026-10-09-core-2a-followups.md` lists known gaps)
- The pipeline is `syntax → check → kir → codegen`. The runtime is linked as a staticlib (built by `cli/build.rs`).

## Commands (run in `kestrel/`)

```bash
cargo test --workspace          # unit, program (JIT + exe) and error tests
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo run -q -p kestrel-cli -- run file.kes
```

Program tests are `kestrel/tests/programs/*.kes`, with `// expect:`, `// expect-exit:` and `// expect-stderr:` lines. Error tests are `kestrel/tests/errors/*.kes`, with `// error <line>: <message>` lines.

## Conventions

- Keep source files under about 400 lines; split by responsibility.
- Error messages are plain sentences that say what to do.
- Never call a bare `link.exe`: Git's coreutils `link.exe` shadows the MSVC linker on PATH (`find-msvc-tools` locates the real one).
